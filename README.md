- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Puzzle (Michael) Moser!

- ðŸ“š I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer, currently enriching my technical toolkit at Atlas School. With a foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies like JavaScript, HTML, Python, and C, I'm excited about crafting efficient and user-friendly web solutions.

- ðŸ›  In my role at Scale AI, I've been developing a keen eye for evaluating and optimizing AI-generated code, blending my programming skills with emerging technologies. My experience at Genesis Health Clubs and managing Samuel Claus has not only sharpened my customer service and project management skills but also given me a unique perspective on user experience and business strategy.

- ðŸ’¡ I'm passionate about applying my tech skills in real-world scenarios, and eager to contribute to projects that are both challenging and impactful. My educational journey has been diverse and dynamic, starting from my homeschooling days, where I nurtured a broad range of interests from musical theater to video content creation, and now steering towards the innovative world of web development. I'm on the lookout for opportunities where I can grow and make a tangible difference, as I believe inspiration is the most valuable currency.

- ðŸ—£ Let's connect and collaborate in the ever-evolving world of technology!
